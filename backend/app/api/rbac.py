RBAC API Endpoints Module

This module defines the FastAPI router and endpoints for RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
analysis and management. It provides REST API endpoints for analyzing Kubernetes RBAC
configurations, retrieving policy rules, and querying permissions.

The API endpoints include:
- RBAC security analysis and findings
- Policy rule retrieval for subjects
- Permission queries ("who can" operations)
- RBAC binding enumeration
- Role-specific rule retrieval
