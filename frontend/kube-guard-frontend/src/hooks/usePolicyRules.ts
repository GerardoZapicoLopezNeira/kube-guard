/**
 * Policy Rules Management Hooks
 * 
 * This module provides specialized hooks for managing RBAC policy rules with
 * intelligent loading strategies and optimized performance. It includes both
 * batch loading for multiple subjects and individual subject loading.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Automatic batch loading of policy rules for all unique subjects
 * - Individual subject policy rule loading with caching
 * - Optimized re-render prevention through memoization
 * - Comprehensive loading state management

 * Primary hook for managing policy rules intelligently.

 * It provides a complete interface for accessing policy rules data.

 * Features:
 * - Automatic extraction of unique subjects from bindings
 * - Batch loading of missing policy rules
 * - Memoized calculations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
 * - Comprehensive state tracking
 * 
 * @returns Object containing policy rules data, loading states, and utility functions
