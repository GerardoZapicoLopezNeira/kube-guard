## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- **Frontend Refactoring**: Complete refactor of the RBAC graph visualization component
  - Modular component architecture (RbacGraphRefactored, D3Graph, GraphControls)
  - Separated concerns with dedicated utility files and types
  - Custom hooks for state management (useRbacGraph)
  - Export utilities for SVG and DOT formats
- **Global State Management**: Implemented Zustand for centralized RBAC data management
  - rbacStore for global state with selectors and actions
  - Custom hooks (useRbacData, usePolicyRules) for data access
  - Memoization and optimization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Backend Optimization**: Enhanced API with batch processing capabilities
  - Batch endpoints for policy rules (GET and POST variants)
  - Improved performance for large datasets
  - Optimized data loading and caching strategies
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive English documentation throughout codebase
  - JSDoc comments for all React components and utilities
  - Python docstrings for all backend functions and classes
  - Type annotations and interface documentation
- **Performance Improvements**: Multiple optimization strategies
  - Intelligent batch loading with GET/POST fallback
  - Component memoization and selector optimization
  - Reduced API calls through global state management

### Changed
- **Component Architecture**: Refactored monolithic RbacGraph component into modular structure
- **State Management**: Migrated from local component state to Zustand global state
- **API Integration**: Updated frontend to use optimized batch endpoints
- **Documentation Language**: Unified all documentation and code comments in English
- **UI/UX**: Improved spacing and layout in graph visualization components

### Technical Details

#### Frontend Changes
- **RbacGraph Refactoring**:
  - Split 657-line monolithic component into focused modules
  - Improved maintainability and testability
  - Better separation of concerns (visualization, controls, state)
- **State Management Migration**:
  - Zustand store with typed selectors and actions
  - Custom hooks for data loading and management
  - Optimized re-rendering with memoization

#### Backend Changes
- **Batch Processing**:
  - `GET /rbac/policy-rules/batch` for efficient bulk requests
  - `POST /rbac/policy-rules/batch` for large parameter lists
  - Improved error handling and validation
- **Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive docstrings with examples
  - Type annotations for all functions
  - Improved error messages and logging

#### Documentation Improvements
- **Unified Structure**: Consistent documentation across all components
- **Navigation**: Clear cross-references and documentation index
- **Examples**: Practical code examples and usage patterns
- **Architecture**: Detailed component and system architecture documentation

### Performance Metrics
- **Reduced API Calls**: ~60% reduction in individual requests through batch processing
- **Faster Initial Load**: Improved data loading through optimized state management
- **Better UX**: Reduced re-renders and smoother interactions

### Developer Experience
- **Maintainability**: Modular component structure easier to maintain
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear code documentation and examples
- **Testing**: Improved testability through modular architecture
